a few assorted iphone classes that i've created while working in ofxiPhone that weren't quite appropriate to fit into the library for different reasons.

ofxiPhoneFile - A class for loading and saving text files to the iphone's documents directory, or loading text files from the internet

ofxiPhoneFlurryAnalytics - A barebones class for implementing Flurry Analytics in your app. You'll need the floor library as well : http://www.flurry.com/
